# Getting Started with Nuxt Content

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example of how to use Nuxt Content to create a blog.

## Features

- Markdown support
- Syntax highlighting
- Front matter
- And much more!

You can write your content in Markdown format and Nuxt Content will automatically transform it into HTML.

```js
// Example code block
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```
